# `Rock Paper Scissors`

## Purpose
This is my very first project working the React.js JavaScript framework! I decided to create a small Rock-Paper-Scissors application because it was one of the first projects that I built when I first learned JavaScript, so I thought it would cool to revisit it! 

## What I learned
- Writing HTML & CSS in React is very similar to writing HTML & CSS with Vanilla JS, but just with styled components instead
- Everytime I call the SetState Hook, it rerenders the entire App, which may cause infinite loops ðŸ˜…
  - useEffect was a good way to counter this
- Function Components can return false if I don't want to return HTML
